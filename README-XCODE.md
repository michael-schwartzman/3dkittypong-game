# 3D Kitty Pong - Native iOS Xcode Project

A native iOS version of the 3D Kitty Pong game built with Swift and SceneKit.

## Project Overview

This is a complete Xcode project that recreates the web-based 3D Kitty Pong game as a native iOS app using:

- **Swift 5.0** - Modern Swift programming language
- **SceneKit** - Apple's 3D graphics framework
- **UIKit** - Native iOS user interface
- **AVFoundation** - Synthesized sound effects
- **Core Haptics** - Tactile feedback

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Game Features
- **3D Pong Gameplay**: Classic pong with 3D graphics and effects
- **Touch Controls**: Smooth pan gesture paddle control
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game speed increases over time
- **Scoring System**: First to 11 points wins
- **Visual Effects**: Corner lights, ball trails, glowing materials

### ðŸ“± iOS Features
- **Landscape Orientation**: Locked to landscape for optimal gameplay
- **Haptic Feedback**: Different vibration patterns for events
- **Synthesized Audio**: Generated sound effects for hits, scores, walls
- **Native Performance**: Hardware-accelerated SceneKit rendering

## How to Build and Run

### Requirements
- **Xcode 15.0+**
- **iOS 15.0+** (deployment target)
- **iPhone or iPad** (recommended for best experience)

### Steps
1. **Open Project**: Double-click `KittyPong3D.xcodeproj` to open in Xcode
2. **Select Device**: Choose your iPhone/iPad or iOS Simulator
3. **Build & Run**: Press `Cmd+R` or click the play button
4. **Enjoy**: The game will launch in landscape mode

### Build Settings
- **Bundle Identifier**: `com.kittypong.game3d`
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 15.0
- **Supported Orientations**: Landscape Left/Right only
- **Status Bar**: Hidden for immersive gameplay

## Game Controls

- **Touch & Drag**: Move your finger up/down anywhere on screen to control your paddle
- **Start Button**: Tap to begin game or restart after game over
- **Automatic**: Computer paddle moves automatically with AI

## Technical Implementation

### SceneKit 3D Scene
- **Materials**: Emissive and specular materials for glowing effects
- **Lighting**: Ambient + directional + point lights for corners
- **Geometry**: Boxes for paddles/field, sphere for ball
- **Animation**: Real-time corner light intensity animation

### Game Physics
- **Collision Detection**: Manual AABB collision for paddles and walls
- **Ball Dynamics**: Velocity-based movement with paddle influence
- **AI Behavior**: Computer paddle follows ball with difficulty scaling

### Audio System
- **Synthesized Sounds**: Generated sine waves for different events
- **AVAudioEngine**: Low-latency audio playback
- **Event-Driven**: Different sounds for hits, scores, walls

### Performance
- **60 FPS**: Smooth gameplay with SceneKit's renderer
- **Metal Backend**: Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering
- **Efficient**: Minimal overdraw and optimized geometry

## Comparison to Web Version

| Feature | Web Version | iOS Native |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| 3D Graphics | Three.js | SceneKit |
| Controls | Mouse/Touch | Native Touch |
| Audio | Web Audio | AVFoundation |
| Feedback | None | Haptic |
| Performance | Variable | 60+ FPS |
| Distribution | Browser | App Store |

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- **Game Center**: Leaderboards and achievements
- **Settings**: Sound/haptics toggle, difficulty selection
- **Multiplayer**: Local or online two-player mode
- **Themes**: Different visual themes beyond the kitty theme
- **Power-ups**: Special effects and gameplay modifiers

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Build Errors**: Ensure Xcode 15+ and iOS 15+ deployment target
- **Audio Not Working**: Check device is not in silent mode
- **Performance Issues**: Test on physical device rather than simulator
- **Orientation Lock**: May need to restart app if rotation gets stuck

**Performance Tips:**
- Run on physical device for best performance
- Close other apps to free up memory
- Ensure iOS device is not in low power mode

This native iOS version provides the full 3D Kitty Pong experience with platform-specific enhancements like haptic feedback and optimized touch controls.
